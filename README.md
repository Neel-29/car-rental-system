## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd car-rental-system
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download AI Model
The system requires the dlib facial landmark predictor model. Download it from:
```bash
# Create models directory
mkdir -p Fatigue-Detection-System-Based-On-Behavioural-Characteristics-Of-Driver/models

# Download the model (you may need to find a valid download link)
# Place shape_predictor_70_face_landmarks.dat in the models directory
```

### 5. Initialize Database
```bash
python app.py
```
The application will automatically create the database and tables on first run.

### 6. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///car_rental.db
DEBUG=True
```

### Database Configuration
The system uses SQLite by default. For production, consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL:
```python
# In app.py, update the database URI
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://user:password@localhost/car_rental'
```
